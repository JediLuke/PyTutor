# Introduction

# Welcome to programming in python, by Luke Taylor
# This code example is a complete, runnable textbook written for my
# bro, Kaelan :)

# In python, some writing is code, and some writing is comments. If the
# line starts with a '#', it's comment, and the computer will ignore it
# (comments are only for us humans).

# This textbook is interactive, run it in a terminal at any time with the
# command 'python lesson1.py'. We shall modify code in this as we go!

# Let's get started.

# Lesson 1
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This program is a tradition, dating back to the first days of programming. The
# 'hello world' program is the first program everybody ever writes, doesn't matter
# what language you're learning.

# For this section of the lesson, you need to comment out the code which is there,
# and then copy it exactly, completing your own first version of this iconic program.


# First program time!
# HelloWorld.py
print ("Hello, world!")   ## Comment me out, by placing a '#' at the start of the line



# Put your version of the code under here
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #




# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Compiling and executing the program
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------



# When we have finished writing a program, we feed it directly into the computer
# using the 'shell' or terminal' (these two words mean the same thing). In this book,
# if we are going to run a command in shell, we shall start the line with some
# characters - it looks like this:
#
# 	$> python lesson1.py
#
# Run this lesson/program by going back to the terminal and typing 'python lesson1.py'.

# If the program doesn't seem to work, you probably have an error. You need to
# fix the code you have written. Don't give up, I promise once you fix it, it's
# a very satisfying experience!
